# CounselMe
### A simple app for accessing and managing patient information
*Using Python, Django, and Docker*


## Main Veiws:
* `login page`     - simple login page
* `admin page`     - manages counselor access to patients as well as other settings
* `counselor page` - access assigned patient(s) information and forms (landing page after logging in?)
* `patient page`   - veiw patient information and contracts
* `form pages`     - forms like contracts, questionaires, etc.
* *Possibly a calender/planner, but this idea is more of a back seat*
